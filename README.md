### Spatiotemporal Transcriptomic Analysis of the Murine Kidney Reveals Compartment-Specific Changes During Cold Ischemic Injury

This repository contains all the codes that were used for the compatuational analysis and
generation of key figures presented in the main article and supplementary section.

The cold ischemia injury (CIS) spatial transcriptomics datasets  necessary to run the codes can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15359609
