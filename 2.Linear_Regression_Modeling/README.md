This folder contains the code demonstrating how to perform linear regression analysis on the cold ischemia injury (CIS) spatial transcriptomics datasets 
(as well as warm-ischemia reperfusion injury (AKI) dataset).

The code also demonstrates how to perform gene set enrichhment analysis (GSEA) thereafter to identify molecular pathways (from different databasses like GO, Hallmark, KEGG)
that are associated with genes that demonstrate significant temporal association with cold ischemia injury progression (or warm ischemia injury).

The results of the linear regression analysis and gene set enrichemnt analysis are provided in Supplmentary Tables. For details regarding the tables, refer to the main article section and Supplementary Tables legends.
